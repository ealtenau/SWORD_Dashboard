# SWORD: the SWOT River Database

### Version 16

SWORD was developed by the SWOT Science Team to serve as the foundation for SWOT river data products. It is based on a variety of datasets, including the Global River Widths from Landsat (GRWL) database, MERIT-Hydro, and the Global River Obstruction Database (GROD). It consists of a series of river nodes (~200 m spacing) and reaches (~10 km long) for which SWOT data will be provided. If you would like more information about SWORD, please see [Altenau et al. (2021)](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2021WR030054).
